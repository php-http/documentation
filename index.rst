===================================

PHP-HTTP is the next step in standardizing HTTP interaction for PHP packages.
It builds on top of PSR-7_, which defines interfaces for HTTP requests and
responses. PSR-7 does not describe, however, the way you should create requests
or send them. PHP-HTTP aims to fill that gap by offering an HTTP client
interface: HTTPlug.

PHP-HTTP has three goals:

1. Encourage package developers to depend on the simple HTTPlug interface
   instead of concrete HTTP clients.

2. Provide good quality HTTP-related packages to the PHP community.

3. Over time, make HTTPlug a PHP Standards Recommendation (PSR) so that clients
   will directly implement the HTTPlug interface and our adapters are no longer
   needed.

HTTPlug
-------

HTTPlug abstracts from HTTP clients written in PHP, offering a simple interface.
It also provides an implementation-independent plugin system to build pipelines
regardless of the HTTP client implementation used.

Packages
--------

PHP-HTTP offers several packages:

=============== =========================================================== ====================================
Type            Description                                                 Namespace
=============== =========================================================== ====================================
Clients         HTTP clients: Socket, cURL and others                       ``Http\Client\[Name]``
Client adapters Adapters for other clients: Guzzle, React and others        ``Http\Adapter\[Name]``
Plugins         Implementation-independent authentication, cookies and more ``Http\Client\Common\Plugin\[Name]``
=============== =========================================================== ====================================

The future
----------

HTTPlug, as a working example of an HTTP client interface, can serve as a basis
for discussion around a future HTTP client PSR.
